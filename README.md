Nitrogen
========

**This project has been abandoned.**

Nitrogen is a web framework that I built up over the course of a few jobs and personal projects.

I have decided to move on from this endeavour and will be building new sites with [Flask][1], and have begun the transition of old sites ([including my own][2]).

I'm leaving this here both for posterity, and the few websites that are still using it.
