/login has the login form.

Going to admin. will redirect you to /login (without the admin.) with a
redirect field that contains the URI you were requesting.

The authentication is controlled with a wildcard cookie (ie ".domain.com").

When logged in there will be a logout button on every page, along with what
user you are logged in as.

Links will carry you from the admin area to the user area (ie adding and
removing of the "admin" subdomain).

All the admin controls will be added to the pages when you are at the "admin"
subdomain.
