One needs to be VERY careful about how imports are handled, both within
nitrogen itself or externally. If you import nitrogen in such a way that it
actually gets imported twice (ie 'app' is in the sys.path, and so import
app.nitrogen and import nitrogen will return DIFFERENT copies of the package)
terrible things will happen.

Don't do it! It leads terrible places! (I am using threading.local objects in
a few places, and if you import nitrogen as a module in a larger package then
some of those objects will be created multiple times, as the modules that
contain them are imported multiple times. Then data is stored on different
objects (which look like the same one) and you will waste many hours trying to
figure out WTF went wront.)

Nitrogen SHOULD be using relative imports for all of it's own work to allow
for it to exist alone or as a subpackage.
