Determine if the path for routing should from from REQUEST_URI or PATH_INFO.
    PATH_INFO appears to be blank. What is it for?

The path the ReRouters match against should be relative.
    Just like in .htaccess

nitrogen.path.unrouted is the relative path of what is unrouted.
    The ReRouter should strip off the front whatever it matched against.

nitrogen.path.routed should be a list of chunks that we matched.
    The parts should be encoded.
    
    Directory and SelfRouter should append a trailing slash to a segment if
    there were still segments to be routed. If it is the last one, then it
    should not have a trailing slash.
    
    The ReRouter will add the entire encoded path secdion
