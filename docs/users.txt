There is always something in app.user.
    It will default to None for non-authenticated users.
    It will be a User object for authenticated users.

Base interface:
    User.set_password(password) sets the password.
    User.check_password(password) checks a password
    User.has_permission(perm) checks if they have the permission

Permissions
	They are . seperated heirarchical strings.
	They are matched similar to Unix style:
	    * matches any segment.
	    ** matched anything.
	        This is not implemented yet. The * currently has this behaviour.
	        If I need this I can do it later.
	    ? for a single character.
	    [seq] for any of seq.
	    [!seq] for anything not in seq.
	Examples:
		blog.create
		blog.edit
		blog.delete
		menu.specials.edit
		menu.*.edit
		menu.*.items.edit
