There are a number of 3rd party libraries in nitrogen/lib that I did not want
to install into the Python sitepackages (because we may be dependant upon
certain versions, and I feel that having many sites running off the same libs
that might change is fragile).

The nitrogen/lib directory is added to sys.path upon import of nitrogen.
