Nitrogen is designed to be a subpackage of the larger application package. Ie.
you should be able to import app.nitrogen.

Upon import it will initialize it's configuration to the contents of
nitrogen.configtools.base . Then it will attempt to import a nitrogenconfig
module. If that is not successful and nitrogen is imported as part of a
package, it will look for a nitrogenconfig module at the same level as itself.
For example, if you get to nitrogen via import app.nitrogen, nitrogen will
attempt to import app.nitrogenconfig to use as a config.

If the nitrogenconfig module is found, it's contents (extracted via
configtools.tools.extract_attributes) will be used to update the config.
