inject the server and config to boers.server and boers.config in some middlewear.
the error handler can read off of that to see wtf is up.
maybe always pass the full environment to jinja as env
	{% if env.boers.server.is_dev %}
		Drop the dump here.
	{% endif %}

cache middlewear
	if the env has been modified to have a boers.cache_duration or whatnot, cache it

session middlewear
	runs off of a cookie

cookie signer
	give it a key, and it signs every cookie going out (checks all the set-cookie headers) and verifies them once they come back in
	this really needs to be in the general cookies thing
		just use a signed cookies container
	first make <expirytime>|<nonce>|cookievalue
	hash it
	then return <hash>|<expirytime>|<nonce>|cookievalue
	c4e71c4ecd34f1f4ee927397d70a320a|1244839877|c4e71c4e|value
	
	cookie container should ignore all cookie errors thrown while a cookie is parsing values through _loads

start_delay
	delays the start until the sub-iterator has been exhausted
	this should be the only one which caches the response like this, ever.


request_builder
	takes an env and start and build a wrapper around them that is "easier" to use
	with get post cookies environ headers etc
	has a print function which we use to print into it

cookies:
	should throw exception when cookies are modified after headers are sent
	or just silently fail and let the start_delay take care of it.
