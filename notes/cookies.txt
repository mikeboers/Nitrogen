cookies should be a dict mapping string keys to string values.
this dict should represent the state of cookies on the broser after this request is done
	newly added ones are added
	those removed via del cookies['stuff'] are deleted
		via max-age < 0
stores the incoming cookies as an immutable dict at parse time
	these should always be availible from the outside

cookies.create(key, value, domain=None, path=None, maxage=None, httponly=None, secure=None)
	creates the mapping in the main store
	creates a mapping in self._attributes[key] = {those which werent none}


OR do it the same as we have it now, but with better property handing and __str__ object
	__str__ goes to the value
	__repr__ goes to the header ('Set-Cookie', 'blah')
	
	if 'key' in cookies:
		print cookies[key]
