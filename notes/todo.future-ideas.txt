- It might be a idea to convert to ascii with xml references at the end,
  instead of actual unicode. Need to look into this.
  
  My feelings are that this is really a waste of bandwidth. Everything should
  actually understand UTF-8 in a raw form.


- URIs:
  	- take a look here: http://bugs.python.org/issue1462525
  	- add a ur(i|l)join function that just joins strings
  	- make notes about actions being defined only for well formed uris
  	- document everywhere that I am and am not complaint with RFC3986
  	- make sure it all works with unicode
  	- make sure it handles IRIs
  	- urlparse library should be RFC3986 conformant (according to the bug page)

- Look into some of the middleware here: http://wsgi.org/wsgi/Middleware_and_Utilities
- Look into using paste.auth (or adapting it) middleware
- Look into using paste.gzipper middleware.
- copy what paste.fileapp is doing (or just use it =P)

- route adapter for normal wsgi apps (so that their changes to PATH_INFO get
  recorded in history). These should setup the SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO to
  something reasonabe before calling the "normal" app, and then update the
  route to sync the data.
