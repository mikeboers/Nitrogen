- The FieldStorage which drives the post parser may have clues as to it's
  content type. Should, perhaps, decode from that instead of utf8.
  
- It might be a idea to convert to ascii with xml references at the end,
  instead of actual unicode. Need to look into this.
  
- route.Mapper could be areally simple dict-based router going off of the
  first segment.

- URIs:
  	- take a look here: http://bugs.python.org/issue1462525
  	- add a ur(i|l)join function that just joins strings
  	- make notes about actions being defined only for well formed uris
  	- document everywhere that I am and am not complaint with RFC3986
  	- make sure it all works with unicode
  	- make sure it handles IRIs
  	- urlparse library should be RFC3986 conformant (according to the bug page)

- Look into some of the middleware here: http://wsgi.org/wsgi/Middleware_and_Utilities
- Look into using paste.auth (or adapting it) middleware
- Look into using paste.gzipper middleware.
- copy what paste.fileapp is doing (or just use it =P)


- route adapter for normal wsgi apps (so that their changes to PATH_INFO get
  recorded in history)


- Add the prowl log handler.

- Basic eTaging middlewear which simply hashes everything it is about to send
  down, and compares it to the eTag. Just saves transmission costs.
