Consider using a Makefile for the main setup file

Consider using virtualenv to manage packages and libraries and such. Can use

Consider putting the server under version control, with most of the server
stuff added to gitignore. Need to be smart about how the databases are handled
to make sure there are never any merge conflicts with them.
