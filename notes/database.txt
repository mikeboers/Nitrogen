Going to be using sqlite again, because it is VERY easy to manage versions of
the database as it is really just a single file.

Not going to go with sqlalchemy-migrate because it will not work very well with
the modularity that I am going for with the framework.

The database file name should have the name of the server in it, so that we
all have our own database file. ie. mike.database.sqlite for Mike's.

    There can be a MASTER.database.sqlite which represents clean schema.

There can be a table in the database which indicated what version it is, OR
the filename itself could contain the number. ie: mike.database-v0.1.sqlite
