-?? heirarchical api method tree
	model.<model_type>.new
	model.<model_type>.<id>.new
	/model/model-type/id/new
	/reflect

-?? encapsulate all the api args some how:
	1) have the args in a sub section: {
		method: 'some_method',
		transport_option: 'something',
		data: {
			key: 'value'
		}
	}


-?? take the source for the YUI uploader and write my own very very simple one
	- this seems pretty stupid of me =P

contain the entire app in a subdirectory similar to the rebelhouse/nitrogen setup

status_helper is a terrible name. remove helper
	status_resolver
	status_fixer
