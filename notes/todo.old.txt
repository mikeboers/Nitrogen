/general
    - build help widgets
	- "today" will be put to 12:00:00 am, which next time will go to 12:00:00 pm. Fix this.
    - editables need to catch api errors and remove the UI block
	- Make flash messages able to persist a number of requests.
		This will require user state.
	- Not found error should have the routing info
	- Add to _500.tpl
	- login email should be case insenitive match
	- some way to log everything that a user does, and have this be accessible to higher tiered admins.
	- not found errors should also log the referer... if it comes from us then that is bad
	- minification
	- etags on everything public side
	- gzip/deflate on js and css files
	- cache and expires headers on all the js and css
	- use google jQuery
	- move javascript to the bottom of the page, except for jQuery
	- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/222581/python-script-for-minifying-css
	- fix the lanaguage of the editable cancel button confirmation

/future
	- Clean up the names of all the formalchemy stuff to *_form from *_fieldset.

		Login controller.
		Logout controller.
	- login throttling
	- password reset email throttling
	- rewrite ALL of the permissions.
	- logout link should account for uris that will not exist on the other side
