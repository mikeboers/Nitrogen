I was running some tests with a prefork server (4 childs max) and the apache
bunchmark tool (concurrency of 4). The app was a generator. It defaulted to
about 350 req/s. When I wrapped it in some middleware that joined it all
together into one string and returned that in a list, it jumped to ~700 req/s!

With the thread_pool server it jumps from ~70 to ~250.

The thread server jumps from ~70 to ~200.

The threading servers appear to take up MUCH less memory than the preforker.
