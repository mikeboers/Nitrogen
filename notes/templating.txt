Consider adapting the CHRML project so that is has more HAML like syntax...
Would actually run it through this file and THEN mako.

Arbitrary python with a dash: - for x in item:

Dollar delimeted variables ala Mako: %a{'href': item.link} ${item.title}

Another option entirely is to write this as a small wrapper around Mako
myself. It really wouldn't be all that bad.
