Think about using ':' as path seperators, and ';' as query seperators.
Think about having path key/value pairs.

scheme:///path should have host = '' (not None) and path = '/path'

How to represent paths?
	list of segments, and an is_relative flag?
		I believe this makes the most sense for most cases.
		Nearly all are going to be absolute
	Move all of the encoding of the path to the Path object
		path.str(no_authority=False, no_scheme=False)
	
	'/a/b/c' -> a, b, c
		str() -> '/a/b/c'
	'a/b/c'  -> a, b, c, relative=True



The Uri class should jump right from the split, and not use parse
the unsplitting should be from an unsplit function
